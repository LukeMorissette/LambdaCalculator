# LambdaCalculator

A command-line _lambda calculator_ designed to mimic elements of a programming language. It supports conditional statements (if/else), for-loops, and basic arithmetic operations.
It was adapted from work done by Alex Kurz from the repository: https://codeberg.org/alexhkurz/lambdaF-2024

## Features

- **Lambda Expressions** – Evaluate lambda expressions via the command line.
- **Conditionals** – Use `if/else` logic within lambda expressions.
- **Loops** – Simple `for` loop-like constructs.
- **Arithmetic** – Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Requirements

- **Bash Shell** (for running `setup.sh`)
- **Python** (if your scripts require it—only include if applicable)
- Any additional libraries or dependencies needed by your scripts (list them here).

## Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LambdaCalculator.git

## Running the Program

- python interpreter.py "<lambda expression>"

## Expression Types

- Refer to testing-data-M1.txt fopr examples
